# todo-list

A simple to-do list that lets you add/delete/update the tasks.

It is a full stack application which uses MERN Stack to perform CRUD(Create,Read,Update and Delete) Operations.

P.S: I'm yet to deploy this application for the time being. For illustration, I have uploaded pictures to show how it works.
